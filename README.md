# My Portfolio

* I created this project to put in practice my knowledge in Front End Development. Obviously, i can't put all i learn at this time, but i think i used many things where're important in website development.
* In this project, the technologies i used are:
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
  * [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
  * [Material UI](https://mui.com/pt/)
  * [Swiper JS](https://swiperjs.com/)
  * [Scroll Reveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/)

# Full responsive
* This is one of my whole projects where are full responsive, because i understand how important is to development a website where i can see in many dispositives.

### Why i think is important always development a full responsive app?
* For my whole life, i only had access to my mobile and my videogame (Playstation 4 specifically). When i bought my computer and i started to development, i always tried to create a responsive app because of that. I'll never know from which device the user might be accessing my site.
